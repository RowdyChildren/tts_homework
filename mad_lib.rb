puts "So I was at a job last week that I\'ll never forget. I had to replace a #{largeNumber1}\n
foot drop and it was colder than #{pluralNoun1} outside. This lady had at least #{number1}\n
DVR\'s and one was covered in #{liquid1}. The living room smelled like old #{food1} and\n
I swear I saw somebodys #{bodyPart1} sticking out under a big pile of junk. She\n
offered me some cold #{liquid1}, but after seeing the DVR I just couldn\'t. I knelt\n
down behind the TV and there was a poster of #{celeberty1} drinking #{liquid1}. I started\n
to think \"Ok... what\'s with this lady and #{liquid1}?\". I fixed the TV and on my\n
to my truck, I saw #{somebodyInClass1}. He yelled \"DUDE. Do not go back in there! That\n
lady ate my #{object1} last time I was here!\" I wasn\'t surprised, because I\n
noticed her looking at my #{object1}. I was determined to get this done though, so\n
I grabbed the nearest #{animal1} and went right back inside. He followed me in, and\n
this lady was in nothing but her #{articleOfClothing1} blasting #{singer1}. \"Ok I\'m sorry, you\'re\n
#{adjective1} lady. Goodbye.\"\n"
